				<h3>Personal Life</h3>
				<p>
					Jolie’s personal life often attracted at least as much attention as her acting. Her relationship with Pitt became fodder for tabloids, and the birth of the couple’s biological children, Shiloh (2006) and twins Knox and Vivienne (2008), caused a media frenzy. Jolie and Pitt married in 2014, but two years later Jolie filed for divorce. Her humanitarian work also drew interest. In 2001 she was named a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). After that appointment she traveled to numerous poverty-stricken countries and adopted children from Cambodia and Ethiopia—Maddox and Zahara, respectively. Pitt later adopted the children, and in 2007 the couple adopted a boy, Pax, from Vietnam. In 2013 Jolie made news for having a preventive double mastectomy after discovering mutations in her BRCA1 gene, which increase the odds of developing breast or ovarian cancer.</p>

					<h3 class="movie-name-heading">Tomb Raider</h3>
					Tomb Raider is a really silly film, and that’s just fine. It’s probably not saying much, but it’s one of the greatest video game movies of all time. What makes it so enjoyable though is Angelina Jolie, who plays the titular Lara Croft. The plot concerns the Illuminati and planetary alignment, and it really does feel like a story line that belongs in a video game.

				<div class="info-maleficent">
					<h3 class="movie-name-heading">Maleficent</h3>
					Disney has been doing a lot of live-action retellings of their classic cartoons lately, and many of them simply keep the same exact story line as the original movie with a few changes here or there. But Maleficent is different. Taking the Wicked approach, it tells the story from the “villain’s” perspective, and Angelina Jolie plays said “villain”.
